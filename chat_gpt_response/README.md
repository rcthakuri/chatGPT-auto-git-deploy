//This program is written in Python

# This program prints the numbers from 1 to 10

# Define a variable to store the start value
start = 1

# Define a variable to store the end value
end = 10

# Use a while loop to iterate over numbers
while start <= end:
    # Print the current number
    print(start)
    # Increment the start value
    start += 1

# Output
# 1
# 2
# 3
# 4
# 5
# 6
# 7
# 8

# Program to calculate the area of a triangle in Python

## Program

```
# This program calculates the area of a triangle

# Ask the user to input the dimensions of the triangle
base = float(input('Enter the base of the triangle: '))
height = float(input('Enter the height of the triangle: '))

# Calculate the area of the triangle
area = 0.5 * base * height

# Print the result
print('The area of the triangle is %0.2f' %area)
```

## Explanation

This program calculates the area of a triangle by asking the user to input the base and height of the triangle. The area of the triangle is then calculated using the formula 0.5 * base * height. The result is then printed to the user.
